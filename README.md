## Contract Flow Diagrams

### 1. Contract Deployment Flow
```
                                    ┌──────────────┐
                                    │  Deployment  │
                                    └──────┬───────┘
                    ┌───────────────────┬──┴────┬───────────────┐
            ┌───────┴──────┐    ┌──────┴───┐    └────┐    ┌─────┴─────┐
            │  XAO Token   │    │Governance│         │    │  Treasury │
            └──────────────┘    └──────────┘         │    └───────────┘
                                                     │
                                             ┌───────┴──────┐
                                             │   Factory    │
                                             │  Contracts   │
                                             └──────┬───────┘
                                         ┌─────────┴────────┐
                                   ┌─────┴─────┐      ┌─────┴─────┐
                                   │   Event   │      │   Artist  │
                                   │  Factory  │      │  Factory  │
                                   └───────────┘      └───────────┘
```
The deployment flow shows the hierarchical relationship between core system contracts. The XAO Token, Governance, and Treasury contracts form the foundation, while factory contracts enable the creation of event and artist instances.

### 2. Event Creation Flow
```
┌─────────┐     ┌───────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│  Owner  │────▶│ Event Factory │────▶  Parent Event   │
└─────────┘     └───────┬───────┘     └────────┬────────┘
                        │                      │
                        │                      ▼
                        │             ┌─────────────────┐
                        │             │  Event Explorer │
                        │             └────────┬────────┘
                        ▼                      │
              ┌─────────────────┐              │
              │ Artist Factory  │◀────────────┘
              └───────┬─────────┘
                      │
                      ▼
              ┌─────────────────┐
              │Artist Contract  │
              └─────────────────┘
```
When creating a new event, the owner initiates the process through the Event Factory, which deploys a new Parent Event contract. The Event Explorer tracks this new event, and the Artist Factory creates associated artist contracts based on the event requirements.

### 3. Ticket Sales Flow
```
┌──────────┐    ┌────────────────┐    ┌───────────────┐
│  Buyer   │───▶│ Parent Event   │───▶  ERC1155/721  │
└──────────┘    │   Contract     │    │  Ticket NFT   │
                └────────┬───────┘    └───────┬───────┘
                        │                     │
                        ▼                     ▼
                ┌────────────────┐    ┌───────────────┐
                │ Event Explorer │    │  XAO Token    │
                └────────────────┘    └───────────────┘
```
The ticket sales process starts with a buyer interacting with the Parent Event contract, which mints NFT tickets (either ERC1155 or ERC721). The Event Explorer tracks ticket availability and sales, while XAO Tokens handle the payment aspects.

### 4. Revenue Distribution Flow
```
┌────────────────┐    ┌────────────────┐     ┌───────────────┐
│  Ticket Sale   │───▶│ Parent Event   │───▶   XAO Treasury │
└────────────────┘    │   Contract     │     └───────┬───────┘
                      └────────┬───────┘             │
                               │                     ▼
                              ▼               ┌───────────────┐
                      ┌────────────────┐      │Artist Contract│
                      │Revenue Splitter│────▶     Escrow     │
                      └────────────────┘      └───────────────┘
```
After a ticket sale, the revenue flows through the Parent Event contract to the XAO Treasury. The Revenue Splitter then distributes the funds according to predefined shares, with artist payments held in escrow until performance obligations are met.

### 5. Arbitration Flow
```
┌──────────┐     ┌────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│Campaign  │────▶│   Dispute      │────▶│  Evidence       │
│Owner     │     │   Filing       │     │  Submission     │
└──────────┘     └────────────────┘     └────────┬────────┘
                                                 │
                                                 ▼
┌──────────┐     ┌────────────────┐     ┌───────────────┐
│  Appeal  │◀────│ AI Decision    │◀────│ IPFS Evidence │
│  Period  │     │ Generation     │     │   Storage     │
└────┬─────┘     └────────────────┘     └───────────────┘
     │
     │           ┌────────────────┐     ┌───────────────┐
     └──────────▶│    Final       │────▶│    Payout     │
                 │  Resolution    │     │   Execution   │
                 └────────────────┘     └───────────────┘
```
The arbitration flow illustrates the dispute resolution process in the XAOMarketing contract. Campaign owners can file disputes, submit evidence (stored in IPFS), and receive AI-generated decisions. The process includes an appeal period, followed by final resolution and payout execution. All stages are time-bound and include multiple security checks.

### Arbitration Process Details

- Automated deadline enforcement

#### 5. Resolution and Payout
- Automatic execution after appeal period
- Validated payment processing
- Updates campaign and dispute status
- Final state verification
