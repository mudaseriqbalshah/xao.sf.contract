1Ô∏è‚É£ XAO Token (ERC-20)
Purpose: Governance, staking, payments, and incentives.
Requirements:
Minting: Fixed supply of 1 billion $XAO tokens.
Transfers & Payments: Allow seamless peer-to-peer transactions and integration with ticket sales.
Staking & Vesting:
Staked tokens generate reputation-based voting power.
Team tokens follow a 4-year vesting schedule with a 1-year cliff.
Governance Integration: Tokens serve as governance weight in hybrid voting with reputation adjustments.
Security: Prevent flash loan attacks and governance manipulation.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Reputation System Contract
Purpose: Implements domain-specific reputation for governance.
Requirements:
Reputation Earned via Contributions:
Development ‚Üí GitHub commits, smart contract audits.
Community ‚Üí Engagement, moderation.
Governance ‚Üí Proposal participation.
Marketing ‚Üí Adoption efforts, social media influence.
Reputation Decay System:
Time-based decay applies uniformly across all domains.
Unstaked tokens lead to reputation loss.
Cross-Domain Weighting:
Developers have 60% higher voting power on Development proposals.
Contributors can vote in general governance with partial reputation weight.

3Ô∏è‚É£ NFT Ticketing Smart Contract (ERC-721 & ERC-1155)
Purpose: Issues NFT-based event tickets with programmable rules.
Requirements:
NFT Minting & Ownership:
Each ticket is unique (ERC-721) or batch-issued (ERC-1155).
On purchase, tickets are minted and assigned to wallets.
Programmable Resale & Royalties:
Enforce royalties to artists, event organizers, and XaoDAO treasury.
Prevent scalping with price floors and resale limits.
Expiration & Upgrades:
After an event, tickets can expire or convert into collectibles.
Optional post-event NFT perks (VIP access, merchandise).
Cross-Chain Compatibility:
Integration with Wormhole or zkSync to support multiple blockchains.

4Ô∏è‚É£ DAO Governance Contract
Purpose: Handles proposal submission, voting, and treasury management.
Requirements:
Hybrid Voting Model:
Token-Based Votes ‚Üí 1 staked $XAO = 1 governance vote.
Reputation-Based Votes ‚Üí Influences weight per domain.
Proposal Creation & Lifecycle:
DAO members submit proposals for funding, platform upgrades, rule changes.
Time-based voting windows.
Execution & Transparency:
On-chain proposal execution when passing quorum.
All votes and results publicly recorded.
Whale Mitigation:
Prevent large token holders from dominating voting without active reputation.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Staking & Reward Distribution Contract
Purpose: Manages staking, profit-sharing, and rewards.
Requirements:
Staking Mechanism:
Users stake $XAO to earn yield and governance power.
Unstaking penalties apply for early withdrawals.
Profit Sharing Mechanism:
Quarterly payouts split among:
35% for team members
35% for contributors
30% for staked token holders
Only stakers who commit for full quarter receive rewards.
Rollover & Treasury Rules:
Unclaimed rewards roll over (70%) and 30% moves to treasury.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Multi-Sig Treasury & Funding Contract
Purpose: Secures treasury funds and manages spending.
Requirements:
Multi-Sig Control:
Treasury managed by a multi-signature wallet (minimum 3-of-5 signers).
Fund Disbursement:
DAO-controlled funding approvals.
Grants allocated to event organizers, developers, and contributors.
Revenue Management:
Ticket sales revenue, staking fees, and platform fees flow into treasury.
Funds allocated transparently via DAO votes.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Cross-Chain & Layer 2 Integration Contracts
Purpose: Expands functionality to multiple blockchains.
Requirements:
zkSync / Optimism Integration:
Low-fee ticket minting and scalable transactions.
Wormhole Integration:
Enables NFT ticket transfers between chains.
Polkadot Integration:
Bridges XaoDAO with multi-chain governance.
