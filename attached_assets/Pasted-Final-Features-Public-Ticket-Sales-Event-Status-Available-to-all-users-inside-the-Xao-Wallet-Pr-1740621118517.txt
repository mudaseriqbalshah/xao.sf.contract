3️⃣ How Wallet-Based Access Works
The Xao Wallet automatically detects when a user (artist/venue) holds a contract-linked asset (e.g., event NFTs, payment guarantees).
Relevant private event details (financials, milestones, payouts) are displayed inside their wallet dashboard.
Regular users only see public data (ticket sales, event lineup) inside the wallet's explorer section.
No login required—wallet holdings dictate access rights.
